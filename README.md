# Star Gazer

Star Gazer is a web app that uses the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to allow users to query the NASA APOD database using a date-range (i.e. a start-date and and end-date); pictures falling within the date-range are returned in a list format, along with their respective dates, titles, and descriptions.

Users are then able to add selected results to a "favorites-list" that may be viewed by other users of the site.

## Getting Started

Just enter a start date and and end date and hit the 'Go!' button to return all APOD entries within the date range. Simple.

### Prerequisites

Nope.

### How to Use

1. Log in to start searching for NASA APODs.
2. Enter a start-date and end-date to return APOD results within specified date range.
3. Click the 'Add' button under each result to save each respective result to the user's personal 'favourites list'.
